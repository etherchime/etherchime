[build]
  # Directory to change to before starting a build. 
  # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.

  # Directory (relative to root of your repo) that contains the deploy-ready 
  # HTML files and assets generated by the build.

  # Directory with the lambda functions to deploy to AWS.

# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds â€“ they do not get scoped to 
# contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files, which are 
# PER-DEPLOY.

# The following redirect is intended for use with most SPAs that handle
# routing internally.
